## [Project 1: Image Deconvolution](https://github.com/Qiong-Hu/Digital_Image_Processing/blob/master/Project1)

### Content

- Apply naive deconvolution, Wiener deconvolution on blurred in frequency domain
- Estimate frequency-dependent Signal-Noise Ratio (SNR) by analyzing the power spectral density of images
- Experiment with different approximation of SNR function for Wiener Filter algorithm
- Quantitatively evaluate performance of different deconvolution algorithms
